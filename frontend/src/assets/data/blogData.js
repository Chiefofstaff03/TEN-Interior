      "In our final part of our Avenue project reveals, let’s take a detailed look at the Master Bedroom, the Boys Bedroom and “His” Office. Megan and Mike wanted a serene and calming bedroom and we understood the assignment. The entire back wall is lined with beautiful windows that overlook forest and water and we knew right away this would inspire so much of the design.",
    para2:
      "We chose to line the windows with gorgeous floor to ceiling drapery and brought the outdoors in by selecting a mossy green linen bedspread, earthy neutral throw pillows and a gorgeous plush rug that has tones of burnt umber, greens, blues and creams – a true nod to the property.",
    para3:
      "The wall where the bed is placed has some interesting curves and angles- which presented a bit of a design challenge when it came to nightstands. We took this as an opportunity to bring in a lighter piece that has just enough room to put a glass of water, charge your phone, or rest a book on! The open and skinny leg detail doesn’t block the view of the drapery and the black gives a pop of contrast. There is plenty of storage in the huge dresser on the opposite side of the room and Megan loves that it won’t just become a junk drawer!",

This truly is a dream space for the most special little girls to grow up in and I am thrilled to be walking you through it today.",
    para2:
      "This space was designed with a sense of wonder in mind, yet curated with timeless details. When our clients engaged us, they wanted us to design a space for their two little girls- a space where they could create cherished memories while also growing into it over time. It was designed with joyful play, and enduring charm and functionality in mind. Every detail was chosen to evoke a sense of creativity and imagination – something we believe is so important for kids spaces.",

      "For Rosie, who is 3, the colour pink was a must have. The entire design began with this absolutely stunning Sanderson wall covering that seamlessly blends this indoor space with nature. We pulled a pink hue from the wallpaper and used it to cover all of the baseboards, window trim and the doors to create depth and a pop of contrast.",

Being it is one of the first rooms you see upon entering the home, we thought there was no better room to start our series with… When our clients engaged Kayla Daniels Interiors, they sought to infuse their home with layers of warmth, personality and thoughtful details that would transform their spaces from functional into soulful.",
    para2:
      "The original space included a built-in unit and a desk our clients already purchased. The built-in unit was getting a bit lost in the sea of white walls and we saw an opportunity to create a better layout for the space by changing the location of the desk. The rug our clients had was too small for the room, and this caused everything look a little out of place.",
    para3:
      "We added softness to the tailored oak desk with custom upholstered ottomans in a creamy linen fabric while the woven desk chair gives a rugged, organic texture. We added custom trim detailing, painted the same colour as the cabinetry, around the entire room to act as a natural extension of the built-in, to balance the space and to add depth. The Grasscloth wall covering above the trim adds dimension and texture and completely envelopes the space in understated luxury, while a gallery of pressed botanicals behind the desk adds vintage charm.",

We sure packed it full – A Family road trip across the country, weekend adventures, swimming, time with friends and intentional rest.I probably sound like most other women in their mid thirties, but I really do love September. Not only for the approaching sweater weather and the reclaim of routines, I also love it for what it represents emotionally. I still get that feeling of “back to school” even though it’s been years since I have been part of any formal educational institute. I appreciate the energy of September more than the beginning of a New Year. It is a time where I feel re-energized, productive and incredibly focused on my goals.",

I am so focused on continuing to evolve our operations and creating an incredible experience for our dear clients. The inspiration and the design work is flowing…. the hardest part is not being able to share finished products yet!",

The space used to have teal coloured high pile carpet and was broken into several different smaller rooms that just did not function for what she needed. She told us that her stuff was scattered all across the house because they had nowhere to store packing materials, she had nowhere to shoot content, store her Jewellery, or pack her orders for her customers.",
    para2:
      "When you walk up the stairs to the loft you enter into the workhorse of the studio. A rustic counter height floating island provides Megan ample space to pack orders and shoot content while the wall to wall closed storage unit can be used hide away packing materials while the butcher block countertop functions as additional workspace for her!",
    para3:
      "We wanted everything in Megan’s studio to be reminiscent of jewellery as well as reflect the vintage element of her business – the light fixtures above the island look like jewels and create the most beautiful effect when lit. We opted for unlacquered brass hardware because it will beautifully patina over time. Earthy tones and organic elements like the wood make the space feel warm.",

There is an element of fun and whimsy to them and I also love the fact that I need to think into the future as we design them. Our goal will kids rooms is that they are presently fun and a reflection of the kids who live in them, while also thinking about the version(s) of them as they grow. We want the spaces to be timeless rather than having too many elements being stuck in a period of time.",
    para2:
      "Two important elements of the design of this room were functionality and storage. Our clients wanted a space where their daughter could do her art, activity books, school work, and other things she enjoys, while also providing plenty of closed storage for her “hoarder tendencies.” PS. that’s her mother’s quote, not mine lol.",
    para3:
      "Having the kids involved in aspects of the design is important. Rather than asking “what colour do you want your room to be” we tend to narrow down to a few (pre approved by the parents) options, and then we bring the kiddos in to make the final say. On the millwork and all the trim we have the colour Bradstreet Beige by Benjamin Moore. This colour is such a winner because it has hints of light pink/ salmon, but contains some taupe undertones. This neutral colour with a little bit of edge, will absolutely stand the test of time as Frances continues to grow in the space. We backed the built-ins with one of my favourite wallpapers from Sandberg. The stripe adds an element of fun and texture. The gorgeous print by Carleigh Courey sits front and centre!",

The 4ft x 6ft island is equipped with tons of storage, houses the microwave and a huge pull out cabinet for garbage and recycling. We also incorporated two floor to ceiling pantry cabinets with pull out drawers that flank the refrigerator.",

      "You don’t necessarily have to order them right away, although with timelines it might actually be the first thing you want to do, but knowing which appliances you want will help you make the most of your layout and design. It’s a lot simpler to create cabinets to surround a range vs. having to find a range to specifically fit your kitchen layout after it is complete. Want panel-ready appliances? This needs to be decided at the very beginning in order to integrate seamlessly into the design.",
